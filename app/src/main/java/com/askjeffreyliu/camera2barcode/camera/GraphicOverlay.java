 * A view which renders a series of custom graphics to be overlayed on top of an associated preview

 * Supports scaling and mirroring of the graphics relative the camera's preview properties.  The
 * idea is that detection items are expressed in terms of a preview size, but need to be scaled up
 * to the full view size, and also mirrored in the case of the front-facing camera.<p>

 * Associated {@link Graphic} items should use the following methods to convert to view coordinates
 * for the graphics that are drawn:
